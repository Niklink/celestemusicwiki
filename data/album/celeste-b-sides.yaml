    <i>Lena Raine:</i>
    Earlier in development, the B-Sides were literally called Remix levels. I was scheduling out my time & realising that doing just the full story progression’s soundtrack was already so much, and we had these harder levels that absolutely needed their own vibe to them, so I thought the best way to approach it would be to literally do remixes for those levels. I ran it by [[artist:maddy-thorson|Maddy]] & the team, and they loved the idea, so I went ahead with it!

    As far as choosing remixers, I reached out to my friends & acquaintances that I thought would suit the game’s vibe super well. Ultimately I wanted to feature a mix of industry vets, as well as up-and-comers that either hadn’t done a lot of game work yet, or wanted to get into games. Surprisingly, all of them said yes!

    Featuring music by the composers of Chordslayer, FTL, Welcome to the Fantasy Zone, Healing, Read-Only Memories, Nuclear Throne, Singularity, and Opus Magnum.
