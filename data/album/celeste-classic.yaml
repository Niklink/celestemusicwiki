    Celeste Classic (known as simply Celeste at the time of its release) was the original incarnation of the gameâ€” while it would eventually become included as bonus content in what is now properly known as Celeste, no release of its soundtrack was ever made. Therefore this page does not correspond to any real album release; all track names are unofficial.

    <i>Niklink:</i>
    Plays at the Old Site (1200m), 2200m (before collecting the powerup), and the Summit.

    Ingame, only the wind noises play without the melody ever kicking in, although it is present in the game files.
