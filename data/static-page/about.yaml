    Welcome to the Celeste Music Wiki!
    This wiki was created by <a href="https://github.com/Niklink">Niklink</a> based on the <a href="https://hsmusic.wiki/">Homestuck Music Wiki</a> and <a href="https://github.com/hsmusic/">its code</a>, which I heavily recommend you check out! The data and media used to build this wiki is <a href="https://github.com/Niklink/celestemusicwiki">available on GitHub</a>.
    While initially a test, it's collated enough information to serve as a useful resource of its ownâ€” it aims to cover all official Celeste music and albums. However, its scope is limited to <i>digital</i> releases. Although the soundtrack has seen a wide variety of physical editions, they don't contain any new material and are a poor fit for the capabilities of the site. In the future, the wiki may grow to support information on soundtracks to Celeste fan mods.
    If you have any feedback or suggestions, the easiest way to get in touch with me for the time being is by visiting the <a href="https://hsmusic.wiki/discord/">HSMusic Wiki Discord server</a>.
